In the small town of dirthmouth, where insects reside, there was an small egg hidden, waiting for someone to break it and release its content. 3 hits was all it takes to unleash the beast inside, the little hollow, a knight made of darkness with one mission: to destroy the light. For accomplishing his goal he needs soul, which allow him to regenerate from wounds and to cast powerful spells. He uses a small nail that allows him to defeat his enemies which are insects possessed by the radiant infection, and protect the village from danger.
